# eScoringInterface
A PC interface for the GliderScore smartphone scoring system.
GliderScore has an eScoring function(see separate GliderScore repository or go to www.gliderscore.com for a full explanation).
This means that generally pilot will scan a QRCode with their smartphone
and this brings up a scoring screen that covers the whole competition.
If a pilot does not have a smartphone, they can use the eScoringInterface
running on a PC to enter scores in exactly the same way.
